For a long time I've been wanting to daily-drive a Linux based operating system due to my familiariy of working with the operating system, something especially true how that I am now working full time with Linux systems. Furthuremore, due to the end-of-life of Windows 10 in future, I thought now would be a good time to switch on my own terms, instead of being unprepared and forced to make a choice then the end-of-life comes around.

## Getting new Hardware

## Picking the Distro

When picking a Distro, I had a few requirements in mind:

- Gaming
- Relativly low maintanence

Origionally I was thinking of picking Debian testing, due to having experiance using Debian derviatives over the years, it being the most familiar distro I know. However, the hardware I was having is rather new regarding new, so there were concerns of incompatability. There are also concerns of not being up-to-date with packages released due to the slow release schedual of new packages.

having a talk to one of my co-workers, I was suggested to have a look at OpenSUSE Tumbleweed. OpenSUSE Tumbleweed is a rolling release, allowing for the latest release of packages. However, compared to something like Arch Linux, the packages are tested to make sure the build is stable before being released, preventing breaking issues from occuring.
